# Refactoring Kata

I tried using a test-driven development practice of writing tests first here. Test cases are written using GildedRoseRequirements.txt

## Refactoring techniques
      Setting up a TDD environment
      Renaming variables
      Using the inline and extract method
	  Enum for Type code
	  Extract number literals to constant
