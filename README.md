# Refactoring Kata

I tried using a test-driven development practice of writing tests first here. Test cases are written using GildedRoseRequirements.txt

## Refactoring techniques
    1. Setting up a TDD environment
    1. Renaming variables
    1. Using the inline and extract method
	1. Enum for Type code
	1. Extract number literals to constant
